# 🚗 Auto Insurance Fraud Prediction

##  Overview
This project explores a dataset of auto insurance claims and builds a simple machine learning model to predict whether a claim is fraudulent.  
It includes basic exploratory data analysis, data preprocessing, and a baseline predictive model to highlight common challenges in fraud detection.

The goal of this project is to practice end-to-end data analysis and modeling using a real-world style dataset.
